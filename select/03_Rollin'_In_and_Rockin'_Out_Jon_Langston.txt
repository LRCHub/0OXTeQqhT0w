Got small town classic city
Gettin' rainy down in Dixie
Everybody say woah
We got that So-Co for the solos
And the dirty thirty from the Texaco, line of trucks down a county road

Rollin' in rockin' out
Chasing that wind
Shaking that ground
Everybody knows everywhere we go from the black top to a green field we steal the show

We sippin it, spillin it, kickin' it, we killin' it, we gettin down, gettin loud, up in the crowd
Rollin' in and rockin' out

Got steel made in Detroit
Big mouths and big noise gasoline wrapped up in chrome
Gonna kiss girls drink a beer spray paint that we were here gonna miss us when were gone

Rollin' in rockin' out
Chasing that wind
Shakin that ground
Everybody knows everywhere we go from the black top to a green field we steal the show

We sippin it, spillin it, kickin' it, we killin' it we gettin down, gettin loud, up in the crowd
Rollin' in and rockin' out

Line of trucks down a county road, yeah here we go

Rollin' in rockin' out
Chasing that wind
Shakin that ground
Everybody knows everywhere we go from the black top to a green field we steal the show

We sippin it, spillin it, kickin' it, we killin' it we gettin down, gettin loud, up in the crowd
Rollin' in and rockin' out
